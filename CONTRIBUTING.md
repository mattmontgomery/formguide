# Contributing to the Form Guide

Want to contribute?

- Check out the existing issues. Is there a bug that you want to solve? A new feature you want to build?
  - If so, reply to the issue and tell everyone you're going to take a stab at it.
  - If not, that's fine. Go for it! Feel free to log a feature request in the issues.
- Fork the project and submit a PR. After feedback and review, we'll review next steps.
